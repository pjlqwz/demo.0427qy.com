                                  <p><p>Small excavator is also known as small mining machinery, the definition of small excavator is also different, such as: in the country where the excavator loader is sold (such as the United Kingdom, France and Italy), 1 to 3 tons of small excavator products are the mainstream. In countries where the use of excavator loaders is not very common (such as Germany), it is more inclined to use 4-6 tons of products. However, almost all countries tend to buy larger equipment, so we conclude that the definition of small excavators is 1 to 6 tons of excavators can be called small excavators, of which 2.7 to 3.0 tons of products accounted for a larger proportion, the reason is that they can easily use common transport vehicles for ground transfer. Small excavators benefit from their small size and become ideal equipment for earthmoving applications mainly in urban areas.</p>
